You can use [VeeWee](https://raw.github.com/jedi4ever/veewee/),
[Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) and
[Virtualbox](http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/) to make chef
development ridiculously funner.


These are the parts of the vagrant automation:

* convert cluster definition to Vagrantfile
* knife provisions vagrant servers
* a set of conventions for using Vagrant with chef in a local debugging or testing environment.
