# File monitoring is not really a part of papertrail but is included here:
#
# default[:papertrail][:watch_files] - This is a list of files that will be
# configured to be watched and included in the papertrail logging. This
# is useful for including output from applications that aren't
# configured to use syslog. Each entry in this list is a hash of:
#
#            [:filename] - Full path to the file.
#            [:tag] - What to tag log lines that come from this file. Best to
#                     use a short application name.
#
# For example:
#
#   node[:papertrail][:watch_files] =
#              [{:filename => "/var/log/myapp.log", :tag => "myapp:"}]
#
default[:papertrail][:watch_files] = []
